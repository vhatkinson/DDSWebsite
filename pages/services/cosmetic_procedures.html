        <h3 id="inv">Invisalign</h3>
        <p>Get the beautiful smile you've always wanted. Invisalign is the invisible way to straighten teeth using a series of custom-made, nearly undetectable aligners. And it's been proven effective in both clinical research and in practices nationwide. So whether your teeth are crowded, too far apart or have shifted since wearing braces, you'll have a new reason to smile.</p>
        <h4>Invisalign technology makes it possible:</h4>
        <p>Upon an initial examination, your Dr. DeLucia decides if Invisalign is right for you. The doctor will write a treatment plan and take an impression of your teeth, which are submitted to Invisalign. Using the latest advances in 3-D computer technology, Invisialign carefully translates the doctor's instructions into a series of precisely customized aligners. You then wear each set of aligners for about two weeks, moving your teeth, gradually - week by week, millimeter by millimeter - until you've achieved the intended result: straighter teeth. Generally, you visit the doctor no more than you would with braces and the length of treatment is about the same.</p>
        <h4>No braces. Nothing to hold you back</h4>
        <p>Because there are no metal wires and brackets, Invisalign is comfortable. And because it is removable, eating, brushing and flossing is no problem. You can still enjoy your favorite foods and smile without holding back. With Invisalign, there's nothing to hide.</p>

        <h3 id="white">Whitening</h3>
        <h4>What is Zoom! Teeth Whitening?</h4>
        <p>Zoom! is a radically new chair side tooth whitening system that uses full-mouth bleaching light combined with a revolutionary 25% Hydrogen Peroxide light activated gel to lighten teeth 6 to 10 shades' in about an hour.</p>
        <h4>The Zoom! Teeth Whitening Technology</h4>
        <p>Zoom! is the culmination of extensive research into light technology, chemical reaction to light and years of traditional tooth whitening experience. Combining this proprietary light technology (specially designed for tooth whitening) with a specifically formulated hydrogen peroxide gel in a two part delivery system results in a tooth whitening system that significantly reduces the time it takes to achieve dramatically whiter teeth.</p>
        <h4>Why Zoom! Teeth Whitening over Competitors?</h4>
        <p>Zoom! was developed by the leader and pioneer in whitening products for professional use, Discus Dental. We believe, Zoom! Is the best, most complete tooth whitening system available today.<br>The proprietary light technology and light activated gel were scientifically designed to work together for faster in-office whitening. Low sensitivity is an important aspect of the Zoom! procedure.</p>

    <h3 id="dentIm">Dental Implants</h3>
    <p>Dental implants are small titanium cylinders that are surgically inserted into the bone of the jaw, to replace the roots of missing teeth. It is a superior treatment for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Denture Implants</li>
        <li>Single Tooth Implants</li>
        <li>Bridge Implants</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dental implants are superior because bone in the jaw is continually loss once teeth have been removed. Implants help to stabilize the bone. Placing a dental implant after a tooth has been loss can prevent a chain reaction of problems that would affect your entire mouth. Teeth need each other for support. When a tooth is lost the biting forces change on the teeth next to the space, and they shift. When a tooth no longer has anything to chew against it begins to extrude out of the socket. You can eventually end up losing it too. When your bite is slightly off its common that one tooth may hit sooner than the rest. This causes undue stress on the involved teeth and they begin to flex. It is this continued flexing and stress over time that causes the enamel to separate from the inner dentin layer forming the familiar looking notch that we call a fraction. As your bite changes it gets harder and harder to chew your food and you may get damage to your jaw joint the TMJ. It is much harder to clean teeth that have shifted. Harmful plaque and tartar collect in these new hard to reach places. Causing cavities and the permanent bone loss that comes with gum disease. A partial denture is another way to solve the problem of missing teeth but there are several advantages of an implant-supported bridge.</p>

        <h3 id="CosmDent">Cosmetic Dentures</h3>
        <p>Are your dentures making you look older than you really are? Your appearance is defined by your smile. One would think that recreating nature with dentures is simple. Actually, it is an art derived from many years of experience. Our custom precision dentures can restore a natural, youthful appearance and more. Dr. Berman has recently published an article in a national journal on creating dentures supported by implants. He sets the standards for how dentures should be made. Conventional or standard dentures refer to dentures that are made with little or no characterization of the front teeth. These dentures are easily spotted and give the wearer a typical "denture look". Cosmetic dentures are made with teeth that have multiple layers of colors and varying degrees of translucency to mimic the natural layers of the tooth. Cosmetic teeth also have an inherent variation in terms of the shapes of the individual teeth in less symmetry and hence a more natural appearance. The use of premium quality cosmetic teeth and skillfully arranging teeth in an asymmetrical but pleasing manner results in a denture that looks more natural.</p>

        <h3 id="CB">Crowns & Bridges</h3>
        <p>Crowns (or caps) are dental restorations that are placed over a tooth when conservative restorations are insufficient to restore form and function.<br>A bridge serves to replace a missing tooth or teeth. One type of bridge consists of crowns placed on either side of the missing tooth to connect the replacement tooth or teeth to them.<br>Another type of bridge consists of the replacement tooth attached to the adjacent teeth with wing-like appendages. Bridges can also be supported by dental implants.<br>Crowns and bridges can be made entirely of tooth-colored material, metal, or a combination to provide optimal aesthetics. Some metal-free crowns and bridges incorporate stress-bearing materials to enhance their strength and wear-resistance.</p>
        <h4>Is A Crown Right For Me?</h4>
        <p>Crowns address aesthetic needs, restore tooth function, and enhance the overall health of your mouth. In cases where teeth have large broken down fillings, a crown can protect and preserve the remaining natural tooth. To enhance your smile a metal-free, tooth colored crown can also replace an older metal/porcelain crown. Following root canal therapy, a crown is typically placed over the remaining tooth structure to preserve aesthetic and tooth function.</p>
        <h4>Is a Bridge Right For Me?</h4>
        <p>In cases where teeth are missing, a bridge prevents the remaining natural teeth from shifting so that dental health and facial aesthetics are not compromised. Bridges may also provide a permanent, non-removable alternative to removable partial or full dentures. Whether supported by natural teeth or implants, bridges can offer life-like aesthetics and stable chewing surfaces. The can be easily maintained by brushing with modified brushing and flossing.</p>

        <h3 id="RCT">Root Canal Treatments</h3>
        <p>When the nerve of a tooth becomes infected root canal treatment can save the tooth. You may realize you have an infected tooth because it's sensitive to hot or cold, it causes swelling and pain, or it gives you a bad taste in your mouth. You may also be completely unaware you have an infected tooth because you experience no symptoms at all. The white outside of the tooth is the enamel. Inside the enamel is another hard layer, the dentin. There's a small chamber inside the dentin called the pulp chamber. The tooth pulp is a soft tissue made up of nerves, arteries and veins. The pulp extends from the pulp chamber down through a narrow channel, which is the root canal, all the way to the tip of the root. In general, teeth at the front of the mouth have one or two root canals, while teeth in the back of the mouth, have two, three or four root canals.</p>
        <p>How do teeth become infected? Though some teeth without cavities can become infected, deep cavities are the main cause of infection. Deep cavities can allow germs to get into the pulp chamber. These germs cause infection and the pulp dies. The pus from the infection eventually builds up in the root tip and makes a hole in the bone. This is called an abscess. The cavity enters the pulp chamber and causes the abscess, which is the dark area at the tip of the root. A blow to a tooth may cause the pulp to die and then become infected. An infected tooth will never heal on its own, and as it gets worse, it will continue to be a source of infection that drags down your immune system, and that can affect your entire body. This damage to the bone and the swelling inside the bone can be excruciatingly painful, and even life threatening. Years ago, an infected tooth would just have to be extracted, but today, we can save your tooth with root canal treatment.</p>

        <h3 id="PVandC">Porcelain Veneers & Crowns</h3>
        <h4>What are Porcelain Veneers?</h4>
        <p>Veneers are a thin, semi-translucent laminent permanently bonded to your teeth. While they're not suitable for every patient, veneers are the most aesthetic alternative for a variety of dental conditions involving the front teeth, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diastemas (spaces between teeth)</li>
            <li>Broken or chipped teeth</li>
            <li>Unsightly, stained, or washed-out fillings</li>
            <li>Permanently stained or discolored teeth that can't be bleached</li>
            <li>Crooked teeth</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Advantages and Benefits of Veneers</h4>
        <p>There are many benefits and advantages to having porcelain veneers placed on your front teeth:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The procedure takes only two appointments</li>
            <li>A conservative amount of tooth structure is removed during the procedure</li>
            <li>Veneers are the most biocompatible material you can use next to the gingiva</li>
            <li>A healthy "natural" look is achieved; in fact, porcelain veneers are the most aesthetic restoration in dentistry.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How are Veneers different from Bonding or Crowns?</h4>
        <p>Bonding is a resin filling material that was used for several years to cover the front surface of teeth. Today, we generally use bonding only to fill in small surfaces or cavities and repair chips in teeth. A full crown is when a tooth has had root canal treatment, or when a substantial amount of the entire tooth structure (enamel) has been lost.</p>
        <h4>How are Porcelain Veneers done?</h4>
        <p>At the first appointment the teeth are prepared for the veneers and an impression is taken. This impression is then sent to a lab where each porcelain veneer is custom made to the dentist's specifications and beautiful temporaries are fabricated to simulate your new smile so you can expect to leave the first appointment looking better than when you came in. At the second appointment the veneers are permanently adhered to the natural teeth.</p>
        <h4>What to Expect</h4>
        <p>Veneers can last indefintely, depending on how well they are taken care of by the patient. Because veneers are stronger than simple bonding, they are also more resistant to stains and chipping. You must maintain regular oral hygiene at home, and visit us for routine cleanings and exams. This is to ensure that your new veneers will look as good as new. Another important point is that oral habits that damage natural teeth such as nail biting, opening bobby pins, and chewing on hard objects can also damage your new veneers. Once veneers are applied, just treat them like natural teeth. They look great and are extremely durable.</p>

        <h3 id="laserDent">State-of-the-Art Laser Dentistry</h3>
        <h4>What is Laser Dentistry?</h4>
        <p>Laser Dentistry is a process of gently washing away decay with laser-energized water droplets. The energy is produced by combining a spray of atomized water with laser energy. The resulting energy gently and precisely removes a wide range of human tissue including tooth enamel (the hardest substance in the body), and soft gum tissue with no heat or discomfort in most cases.</p>
        <h4>What are the benefits of Laser Dentistry?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat and vibration are the causes of most of the discomfort associated with the drill. Since laser cutting does not transmit heat or vibrations, many dental procedures can be performed without anesthesia, in most cases.</li>
            <li>The laser's pinpoint accuracy is precise enough that your dentist can leave in place as much healthy tooth structure as possible, allowing you to keep your own teeth longer.</li>
            <li>Gently performs numerous soft gum tissue procedures with little or no bleeding. The laser gives Dr. DeLucia a new high-tech tool for many procedures that previously required referral to a specialist. Now you can have them performed during your scheduled appointment and feel better afterwards.</li>
            <li>The laser prepares your teeth in a way that maximizes the bonding of tooth colored fillings, allowing them to last longer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What else can Laser Dentistry be used for?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Root Canals</li>
        <li>Decay Removal</li>
        <li>Cavity Preparation</li>
        <li>Smile Design</li>
        <li>General Soft Tissue Procedures</li>
        <li>General Dentistry for Enamel and Dentin</li>
        <li>Avoid the Shot & being "Numbed"</li>
