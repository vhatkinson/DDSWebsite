        <h4 class="center_p">The Clear Alternative to Braces<span class="reg_tm">&reg</span></h4>
        <p>Developed with Orthodontists, Invisalign is a virtually invisible solution, so you can smile confidently both during treatment and after. Using a series of clear, removable aligners, Invisalign gradually moves your teeth toward the smile you've always wanted. and, almost no one will know you're wearing them unless you tell them.</p>
        <h4>Clear, Removable, Comfortable</h4>
        <p>Invisalign is comfortable to wear and easy to live with. You visit your doctor every month or two to check your progression and get new aligners. Average treatment time is about a year. Beause the new aligners are removable, you can continue to eat your favorite foods. And you can brush and floss normally to keep your teeth and gums healthy.</p>

    <h3 id="dentIm">Dental Implants</h3>
		<p>Dental implants are the new standard of care for tooth replacement. They bond with healthy bone and provide permanent support for dental crowns and dentures. Dental implants, like natural teeth, stimulate the jaw and stop bone loss. The types of dental implants are:</p>
    <ul class="center_list_large">
        <li>Single Tooth Implant</li>
        <li>Multiple Teeth and Bridge Implants</li>
    </ul>
		<h4>Single Tooth Implant</h4>
		<p>A missing tooth can be replaced by a dental implant without altering the healthy adjacent teeth. Once the implant is placed, a post (or abutment) is attached providing support for your final crown.</p>
		<h4>Multiple Teeth and Bridge Implant</h4>
		<p>If you are missing more than one tooth, dental implants may be your best treatment potion. Multiple implants are placed with individual crowns or a multi-unit bridge to rejuvenate your smile.A bridge is used if more than two adjacent teeth must be replaced. Instead of performing three individual single tooth implants, the outer missing teeth are held in place with the implant and they support the middle tooth, forming a bridge.</p>

        <h3 id="IRD">Implant Retained Dentures</h3>
        <p>There are three types of implant retained dentures:</p>
        <ul class="center_list_large">
            <li>Fixed implant-supported dentures</li>
            <li>Removable implant-supported dentures</li>
            <li>Implant-stabilized dentures</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Fixed Implant-Supported Dentures</h4>
		<p>If all your upper or lower teeth are missing, a custom-made denture may be permanently secured using implants. The number of implants will vary for each patient. Your new teeth are firmly supported by the implants, stimulating the jaw and halting bone loss. Dr. DeLucia provides a service for maintaining and cleaning the denture.</p>
        <h4>Removable Implant-Supported Dentures</h4>
		<p>If all upper or lower teeth are missing, multiple implants may be used to support a new removable denture that will attach securely to a custom-made bar. Your new teeth are firmly supported by the implants, stimulating the jaw and halting bone loss. Your new denture can be removed daily for cleaning.</p>
        <h4>Implant-Stabilized Dentures</h4>
		<p>If all your lower teeth are missing, another option may be to stabilize your removable denture using a small number of implants. This can sometimes be a cost-effective solution. After healing, abutment posts are attached to the implants. Your current denture can sometimes be modified, or a new denture can be created. Your denture is snapped into place and can be removed daily for cleaning.</p>

        <h3 id="CosmDent">Cosmetic Dentures</h3>
        <p>Are your dentures making you look older than you really are? Your appearance is defined by your smile. One would think that recreating nature with dentures is simple. Actually, it is an art derived from many years of experience. Our custom precision dentures can restore a natural, youthful appearance and more. Conventional or standard dentures refer to dentures that are made with little or no characterization of the front teeth. These dentures are easily spotted and give the wearer a typical "denture look". Cosmetic dentures are made with teeth that have multiple layers of colors and varying degrees of translucency to mimic the natural layers of the tooth. Cosmetic teeth also have an inherent variation in terms of the shapes of the individual teeth in less symmetry and hence a more natural appearance. The use of premium quality cosmetic teeth and skillfully arranging teeth in an asymmetrical but pleasing manner results in a denture that looks more natural.</p>

        <h3 id="CB">Crowns & Bridges</h3>
        <p>Crowns (or caps) are dental restorations that are placed over a tooth when conservative restorations are insufficient to restore form and function.<br>A bridge serves to replace a missing tooth or teeth. Bridges can also be supported by dental implants.<br>Crowns and bridges can be made of conventional porcelin fused to gold,or porcelin over zirconium, a combination to provide optimal aesthetics. </p>
        <h4>Is A Crown Right For Me?</h4>
        <p>Crowns address aesthetic needs, restore tooth function, and enhance the overall health of your mouth. In cases where teeth have large broken down fillings, a crown can protect and preserve the remaining natural tooth. To enhance your smile a metal-free, tooth colored crown can also replace an older metal/porcelain crown. Following root canal therapy, a crown is typically placed over the remaining tooth structure to preserve aesthetic and tooth function.</p>
        <h4>Is a Bridge Right For Me?</h4>
        <p>In cases where teeth are missing, a bridge prevents the remaining natural teeth from shifting so that dental health and facial aesthetics are not compromised. Bridges may also provide a permanent, non-removable alternative to removable partial or full dentures. Whether supported by natural teeth or implants, bridges can offer life-like aesthetics and stable chewing surfaces. The bridge can be easily maintained by brushing with modified brushing and flossing.</p>

        <h3 id="RCT">Root Canal Treatments</h3>
        <p>When the nerve of a tooth becomes infected root canal treatment can save the tooth. You may realize you have an infected tooth because it's sensitive to hot or cold, it causes swelling and pain, or it gives you a bad taste in your mouth. You may also be completely unaware you have an infected tooth because you experience no symptoms at all. The white outside of the tooth is the enamel. Inside the enamel is another hard layer, the dentin. There's a small chamber inside the dentin called the pulp chamber. The tooth pulp is a soft tissue made up of nerves, arteries and veins. The pulp extends from the pulp chamber down through a narrow channel, which is the root canal, all the way to the tip of the root. In general, teeth at the front of the mouth have one or two root canals, while teeth in the back of the mouth, have two, three or four root canals.</p>
        <p>How do teeth become infected? Though some teeth without cavities can become infected, deep cavities are the main cause of infection. Deep cavities can allow germs to get into the pulp chamber. These germs cause infection and the pulp dies. The pus from the infection eventually builds up in the root tip causing a great amount of pain and eventually makes a hole in the bone. This is called an abscess.A blow to a tooth may also cause the pulp to die and then become infected. An infected tooth will never heal on its own, and as it gets worse, it will continue to be a source of infection that drags down your immune system, and that can affect your entire body. This damage to the bone and the swelling inside the bone can be excruciatingly painful, and even life threatening. Years ago, an infected tooth would just have to be extracted, but today, we can save your tooth with root canal treatment.</p>

        <h3 id="PVandC">Porcelain Veneers & Crowns</h3>
        <h4>What are Porcelain Veneers?</h4>
        <p>Veneers are a thin, semi-translucent laminent permanently bonded to your teeth. While they're not suitable for every patient, veneers are the most aesthetic alternative for a variety of dental conditions involving the front teeth, including:</p>
        <ul class="center_list_xlarge">
            <li>Diastemas (spaces between teeth)</li>
            <li>Broken or chipped teeth</li>
            <li>Unsightly, stained, or washed-out fillings</li>
            <li>Permanently stained or discolored teeth that can't be bleached</li>
            <li>Crooked teeth</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Advantages and Benefits of Veneers</h4>
        <p>There are many benefits and advantages to having porcelain veneers placed on your front teeth:</p>
        <ul class="center_list_xlarge">
            <li>The procedure takes only two appointments</li>
            <li>A conservative amount of tooth structure is removed during the procedure</li>
            <li>Veneers are the most biocompatible material you can use next to the gingiva</li>
            <li>A healthy "natural" look is achieved; in fact, porcelain veneers are the most aesthetic restoration in dentistry.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How are Veneers different from Bonding or Crowns?</h4>
        <p>Bonding is a resin filling material that was used for several years to cover the front surface of teeth. Today, we generally use bonding only to fill in small surfaces or cavities and repair chips in teeth. A full crown is required when a tooth has had root canal treatment, or when a substantial amount of the entire tooth structure (enamel) has been lost.</p>
        <h4>How are Porcelain Veneers done?</h4>
        <p>At the first appointment the teeth are prepared for the veneers and an impression is taken. This impression is then sent to a lab where each porcelain veneer is custom made to the dentist's specifications and beautiful temporaries are fabricated to simulate your new smile so you can expect to leave the first appointment looking better than when you came in. At the second appointment the veneers are permanently adhered to the natural teeth.</p>
        <h4>What to Expect</h4>
        <p>Veneers can last indefintely, depending on how well they are taken care of by the patient. Because veneers are stronger than simple bonding, they are also more resistant to stains and chipping. You must maintain regular oral hygiene at home, and visit us for routine cleanings and exams. This is to ensure that your new veneers will look as good as new. Another important point is that oral habits that damage natural teeth such as nail biting, opening bobby pins, and chewing on hard objects can also damage your new veneers. Once veneers are applied, just treat them like natural teeth. They look great and are extremely durable.</p>

        <h3 id="laserDent">State-of-the-Art Laser Dentistry</h3>
        <h4>What is Laser Dentistry?</h4>
        <p>Laser Dentistry is a process of gently washing away decay with laser-energized water droplets. The energy is produced by combining a spray of atomized water with laser energy. The resulting energy gently and precisely removes a wide range of human tissue including tooth enamel (the hardest substance in the body), and soft gum tissue with no heat or discomfort in most cases.</p>
        <h4>What are the benefits of Laser Dentistry?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat and vibration are the causes of most of the discomfort associated with the drill. Since laser cutting does not transmit heat or vibrations, many dental procedures can be performed without anesthesia, in most cases.</li>
            <li>The laser's pinpoint accuracy is precise enough that your dentist can leave in place as much healthy tooth structure as possible, allowing you to keep your own teeth longer.</li>
            <li>Gently performs numerous soft gum tissue procedures with little or no bleeding. The laser gives Dr. DeLucia a new high-tech tool for many procedures that previously required referral to a specialist. Now you can have them performed during your scheduled appointment and feel better afterwards.</li>
            <li>The laser prepares your teeth in a way that maximizes the bonding of tooth colored fillings, allowing them to last longer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What else can Laser Dentistry be used for?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Root Canals</li>
        <li>Decay Removal</li>
        <li>Cavity Preparation</li>
        <li>Smile Design</li>
        <li>General Soft Tissue Procedures</li>
        <li>General Dentistry for Enamel and Dentin</li>
        <li>Avoid the Shot & being "Numbed"</li>

    	<h3 id="gum">Gum (Periodontal) Treatment</h3>
		<h4>What is gum disease?</h4>
		<p>Gum disease is the swelling or soreness of the gums (soft tissue) around your teeth. It is caused by bacteria in plaque, a sticky, colorless film that forms on your teeth.</p>
		<p>the plaque bacteria produce toxins that can lead to inflammation of the gums called gingivitis. This initial stage of gum disease is reversible. However, if you do not remove plaque by brushing and flossing your teeth, it can build up and infect your gums, teeth and the bone tha supports the,, leading to a more severe form of gum disease, periodontitis. If left untreated, periodontitis can result in the loss of bone and teeth.</p>
		<p>The signs of gum disease are not always easy to see and can be painless. The earlier gum disease is caught, the easier it is to treat. That's why it's important to see your dentist regularly.</p>
		<h4>What should you do to help prevent gum disease?</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Brush with a soft-bristled toothbrush and clean between teeth wih floss or an interdental cleaner the way your dentist tells you to do.</li>
			<li>Brush your teeth twice a day</li>
			<li>Get regular professional dental cleanings at least twice a year. This is the only way to remove plaque that has hardened into tarter. You may not be aware that this has happened. Dr. DeLucia will need to evaluate and clean or "scale" your teeth to remove the tartar above and below the gumline.</li>
			<li>Do not smoke cigarettes or use other forms of tobacco.</li>
			<li>If your condition is very serious, additional treatment may be necessary. Dr. DeLucia will tell whether you will need treatment in addition to a routine cleaning.</li>

		<h3 id="ext">Extractions</h3>
		<p>Whenever possible, the goal of restorative and periodontic dentistry is to conserve as much of your natural tooth structure as possible. However, there are some instances where the natural tooth or supporting bone is damaged beyond the point of being salvageable. In these cases, tooth extraction is the most reasonable and effective course of treatment.</p>
		<p>Dr. DeLucia uses the &#xD6;gram System-an advanced, atraumatic, non-invasive bioengineered micro-motion exodontia (extraction) technology system for the 21st century.</p>

		<h3 id="cosmBond">Cosmetic Bonding</h3>
		<p>Dental bonding is a procedure in which a tooth-colored resin material (a durable plastic material) is applied and hardened with a special light, which ultimately "bonds" the material to the tooth to restore or improve person's smile.</p>
